Domain Explorer is a simple tool for batch analysis of domain names.
It is a PHP script designed to be run on a web-server.

You give it 

 * Name server
 * Mail server IP and host 
 * Web server IP and host

The hosts listed are determined by reverse DNS, so that you can more easily see
the "actual" server that is hosting a given site.

It is useful for answering questions like "which of these domains hosted on our
server are still actually active?"
