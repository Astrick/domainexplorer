h1. Domain Explorer

Domain Explorer is a simple tool for batch analysis of domain names It is a PHP script designed to be run on a web-server.  It is not currently publicly hosted.

Give it a list of domain names, and it will return the following information:

 * Name server
 * Mail server IP and host 
 * Web server IP and host

The hosts listed are determined by reverse DNS, so that you can more easily see the "actual" server that is hosting a given site.

It is useful for answering questions like "which of the domains hosted on our server are still actually active?"
